# Landing page

This repository contains the code my landing page. For me a landing page is
something that I used to do when I was a kid and the internet was a bit more
free-form. I would load a simple HTML file as my initial page whenever I'd open
a browser window; funny there were no tabs back then just windows ðŸ™‚. So I'd
fire up my favorite browser and a little customized landing page would exist
with things that I found useful or interesting or maybe just wanted to come back
to.

Now the internet is a much different place. It's important to advertise yourself
on there and this idea of a landing page is now in it's next evolution. This
landing page serves as a small space on the web to showcase my skills,
development, and perhaps links about myself.
