# Landing page

This repository contains the code my landing page. You can visit the landing
page at [https://rogeruiz.srht.site/](https://rogeruiz.srht.site/).

The website will eventually move over to [https://rog.gr/](https://rog.gr/) when
I'm complete I'll also be moving my repository over from GitHub as well.

## This project uses Bun

This project leverages [Bun](https://bun.sh) as the automation and package
manager. Ensure you have `bun` in your path when running the scripts in the
`package.json` file. An example for running the development server is below.

```sh
bun run dev
```

Run `bun run` to see the other options available to you.
